# Tiny Tuple

A kvasir MPL based tuple and associative lookup container.
It is usually faster than recursively defined `std::tuple` implementations.
The main feature of this header library is the associative lookup container.
Besides that it just does not have as many constructors as tuple and does
not have `std::pair` compatibility.

## Dependencies

* Kvasir MPL
* C++ type traits and utility header
